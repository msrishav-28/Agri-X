✖ Check for issues with Metro config
It looks like that you are using a custom metro.config.js that does not extend "expo/metro-config". This can lead to unexpected and hard to debug issues. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/guides/customizing-metro/
Advice:
Update your "metro.config.js" to extend "expo/metro-config".

✖ Check that required peer dependencies are installed
Missing peer dependency: react-native-worklets
Required by: react-native-reanimated
Advice:
Install missing required peer dependency with "npx expo install react-native-worklets"
Your app may crash outside of Expo Go without this dependency. Native module peer dependencies must be installed directly.

✖ Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.json, indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, if you don't run prebuild in your build pipeline, the following properties will not be synced: orientation, icon, userInterfaceStyle, splash, android. 


✖ Validate packages against React Native Directory package metadata
The following issues were found when validating your dependencies against React Native Directory:
  Untested on New Architecture: react-native-geolocation-service, react-native-navigation-bar-color, react-native-tts
  Unmaintained: react-native-geolocation-service, react-native-navigation-bar-color
  No metadata available: react-native-vector-icons
Advice:
Use libraries that are actively maintained and support the New Architecture. Find alternative libraries with https://reactnative.directory.
Add packages to expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.exclude in package.json to selectively skip validations, if the warning is not relevant.
Update React Native Directory to include metadata for unknown packages. Alternatively, set expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.listUnknownPackages in package.json to false to skip warnings about packages with no metadata, if the warning is not relevant.

✖ Check that packages match versions required by installed Expo SDK

⚠️ Minor version mismatches
package       expected  found   
@types/react  ~19.1.10  19.2.9  
typescript    ~5.9.2    5.8.3   



2 packages out of date.
Advice:
Use 'npx expo install --check' to review and upgrade your dependencies.
To ignore specific packages, add them to "expo.install.exclude" in package.json. Learn more: https://expo.fyi/dependency-validation
