## 1. myScheme API - Student Access Request

**To:** support@apisetu.gov.in, helpdesk.digitalindia@meity.gov.in  
**Subject:** Request for myScheme API Access - Student Developer Project

---

Dear API Setu Team,

I am a student developer from [University Name] building **AgriX**, an open-source mobile app to help Indian farmers discover government schemes and agricultural advice.

I wish to integrate the myScheme API to provide farmers with personalized scheme eligibility checks. However, I noticed the sign-up requires organizational documents (GST, PAN, Certificate of Incorporation) which are not applicable for student projects.

**Request:** Could you please advise on how students/academic projects can access the myScheme API for educational and social impact purposes?

**About AgriX:**
- Multilingual farming app (8 languages)
- AI-based crop disease detection
- Government scheme discovery for farmers
- Open-source, non-commercial project

I'm happy to provide student ID, project documentation, or faculty endorsement as alternative verification.

Thank you for your time.
