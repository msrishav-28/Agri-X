## Intended Use Case for ALU API

1. **Crop Health Monitoring** - Satellite-based NDVI for early disease warnings
2. **Field Boundary Detection** - Help farmers document land for loans/insurance
3. **Crop Classification** - Auto-identify crops for personalized advice
4. **Yield Prediction** - Data-driven harvest forecasting

## Why This Matters

86% of India's 150M+ farms are small-holder (<2 hectares). ALU API can democratize satellite insights to farmers with just a smartphone.

I'm committed to open-sourcing integrations and presenting at GDG/student events.
